title: About

I aspire to be someone who embodies the passion for being data-driven. I am passionate about the okpen source world and have been involved in a couple of git projects. I always look forward to learning more about computer science or machine learning algorithms in order to ask interesting questions and solve interesting problems.

Generally, I enjoy a good jog in the park, watching and playing football, playing an instrument etc. I would like to look forward to meeting new people that have similar technological interests to me to collaborate on interesting GitHub projects that involve a lot of 'hacking'.
