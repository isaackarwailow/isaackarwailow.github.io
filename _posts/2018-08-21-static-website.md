title: Why make a static website?
---
A lot of people may be wondering, "Isaac, why should I make a static website? Why not pay for a domain and start my own website on WordPress or Wix?"
Well, good question. I see WordPress as the sort of main player in the development game. And sure, if you are serious about starting a dynamic website then WordPress can suit you. However, I am heavily biased toward the static website and here is the mini cost benefit analysis of the two services, a little old school analytic breakdown of the two technology classes:

| Static Website | Dynamic Website |
|--------|---------|
| **Advantages**|
|time-saving|easy to update|
|cost-effective|interactive|
|inexpensive hosting|quick to responsiveness|
|easy indexing|smooth navigation|
|fast transferring||
|**Disadvantages**|
|Difficult to Change|higher cost|
|not good in the long run|slow processing|
|limited functionality||
