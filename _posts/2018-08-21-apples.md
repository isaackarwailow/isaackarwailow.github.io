title: Interview Tips - Tell us about yourself?
---
Here I want to write about answering the "Tell us about yourself" question. I chose this question to address because it is one of the most common and the one most people probably want feedback on.

First off, there is a myth that you should give them a whole life story. This is NOT true and should never be done. What you are really doing is selling your skill and suitability. What should happen is you have to summarize your professional history, and quantify some of your achievements. I know it sounds like a repeat of your resume, but that's literally what this question was intended for. Also, you must follow up the summary with how you fit the position/ role and why you applied for the position. So,

1) Summarize your professional history up to this point

2) Explain why you are a good fit for the role and use phrases that demonstrate the skills that match their Key Selection Criteria.

Do NOT listen to anybody who tells you otherwise this is ALL there is to this question. It is all the same.
