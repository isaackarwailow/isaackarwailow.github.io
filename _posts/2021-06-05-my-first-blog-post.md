I will start my blog my saying that I really thoroughly enjoy making new projects on GitHub. My life has definitely
changed a lot after completing a Certificate of Data Science and AI. As a young kid, I was always intrigue by certain
hacks done on technology. For example, using torrent trackers and port fowarding to speed up downloads.

However, those were the kinds of tricks that anyone could do, as long as they copy and pasted the technique they really
wanted. I wasn't about to brand myself as just someone that follows the status quo. But I knew that if I were to be a
great Data Science/ AI practitioner, I am going to need to be competent. So here are just a few things I have written
down in my diary that are activities that I think anyone can do if they have the desire and passion to become a Data
Scientist.

**Daily activities for becoming a data scientist:**

- Complete ANZ virtual internship
- Study Scientific Computing with Python with FreeCodeCamp
- Study JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures with Free Code Camp
- Apply for 3 other jobs
- Update Blog on Jekyll

It has been a wonderful learning journey with RMIT and the Institute of Data and I am constantly enthusiastic
about learning new things and collaborating with people on new, exciting and innovative
projects. Bon voyage!
