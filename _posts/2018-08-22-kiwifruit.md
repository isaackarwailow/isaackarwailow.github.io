title: Why I like hacking but not the profession of hacking
---

Now don't get me wrong. Hacking, in the traditional sense - is great. I'm talking the budding geniuses of MIT in the 1980s, or the recent books being written about Linus Torvalds. The most famous references that seems to hit the home run in terms of defining the term 'hacker' for me is, [*The Cathedral and the Bazaar* by Eric S.Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar).

The book starts out by painting a picture of the open source dream. And if you were like me growing up, you know one when you see one. That means you know what it is like when someone shares your passion. I have known very few people that actually have passion in information technology. They misunderstand that something can be a subject, but not an object.

A lot of these suit and tie people read Raymond's book like its some sort of intellectual tool to get higher up the hiring chain. It is similar to a lot of these Women in IT conferences and the ones where Kevin Mitnick shows up to talk about his past. There is *nothing* innovative about these things. Until now, the ground of information security has always been ceded to the professionals. The hackers of MIT are made to be a big deal in the press.

Anyway, the point is, that you can not just be a hacker, you can be yourself, do the things you enjoy, *and* be a professional at the same time. They are not mutually exclusive ideals. What I object to the most, is these insidious soul-selling activities that results from passionateless people that desire to steal our time and energy. Mostly, money-minded people.

These are people on the road that only want to get past you disrespectfully because they are part of a 'rat' race, rather than something bigger they are striving for. Why? because 'other people' are more important. What they mean is their own family/ legacy. Or the people who claim to understand the open source dream and then hoard scientific or inside information because they have half their foot in the rat race and therefore need red tape to ensure their safety.

I have no disrespect for people like that. In fact, I do respect their hustle game. I also have a lot to learn from the practicality of self-sacrifice, as these people usually are very good with taking care of families as well as other people. They implicitly send a message to their children: 'Just make a living. And have a good life.' Nothing wrong with that. However, these are the same people who will go up to little Timmy Neuron, whose parents told him 'science will change the world', and tell him to just do what the boss says.

Personally, I think people who are actually passionate about science ought not to be silent and let these hustlers take away their voice. They may say they have good lives, but what is a life whose worth is lost? It is a selling of the soul that is at stake, and the sinners have spoken. So there's their verdict, and I would like to keep my laundry clean, thank you very much.
