title: How to Get Your First Job
---

Good news, guys! I will be starting with NAB in approx 2 weeks! At the moment they are still writing out the contract. I am doing a background check. Once that's done. Should be all good. I will be working with the Data Engineering and Intelligence team, reporting under the Head of Operations of Enterprise AI. 

Now enough of my ranting. I thought I'd just detail my experience of getting a job and what I would tell other people who were in a similar position like I am now on finding a job.

Firstly, resume, cover letter and interview guidance material is only 10% of the battle! You heard me, 10%. In fact, I would even go so far to say as those material were completely useless. Now please do **not** quote me on this less I be quoted out of context. I am not *saying* that you should not use material in helping you polish up your job hunting game. What I am saying is that there is a lot more under the hood that often doesn't get mentioned.

Other than telling you its just luck, I have some useful feedback for those who were in my position:

1) It's a matter of personality, even though most people assume it is about your qualification
* The truth is it may be useless that I am telling you this, because it is so often told as a cliche. However, it is true.
* The vast majority of employers out there may be pedantic on every single nitty gritty on your resume.
* But, there are also those that value you as a person and want to give you a chance. In fact, most of the employers are like that here in Australia! Ask the HR for feedback, if it is because of the timing and not your competence. Trust them! They know what they are talking about.

2) Ask interviewers/ HR for feedback
* The truth is, it is easy to get disheartened when you don't get what you want.
* Keep things simple. When you go through your day, do things one step at a time towards your goal. Always have time for yourself.

3) Understand your rights in this country
* Confidence can be built from the land of down under when you practice speaking out who you are and what you believe.
* Do not believe that people who are more powerful than you are out to get you. Do things that make you happy.
* Patience is key. Everything in life is built one step at a time.
* Do not believe anyone that says that expenses cannot be reduced. In other words get some financial acumen. Read up about how to get a home loan or invest in the right kind of insurance. This may be more for banking people but the rule still applies

4) Trust your gut and your economical rationale. Not other people.
* The true worth of a product is in the amount you are willing to spend to get it. You need economic rationale to survive. And might I emphasize, a very sharp eye for details in spotting the small print.
* Think like a lawyer. Always read the small print because there lies the advantage and the disadvantage. You are not in school anymore.
* People of high networth spend more, they don't actually save more. Again, it's not in what you save but how much from what your giving are you getting in return.
