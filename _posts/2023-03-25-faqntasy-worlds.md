title: The theory of fantasy worlds
---

Ever heard the saying that ignorance is bliss? Well I have this theory. If ignorance is bliss, why not push the idea further, by increasing happiness through the action of increasing ignorance?

I'm kidding. But the notion still holds. I have this dream where I was in a kind of Milton's Paradise. Perfect beings conversed with me in some unknown language then I was dropped back to earth with some magic note from some distant friend I can barely remember now that I fell to earth. Some kind of holographic note that looks the same from all angles no matter how the light touches the paper.

Yea I know. Big imagination. But the dream got me thinking that all possible fantasy worlds have one thing in common. Take example soccer. Soccer on its surface is actually a reduction in one dimension of capability. And if you think about it so is every game. So every fantasy world can be explained in a simple math equation

Fantasy World = A - I where I is a dimension of A

I believe that every Fantasy World has one thing in common. They all have mutual participants that have agreed to ignore a part of reality. That explains soccer, basketball and most other sports. The truth is that purpose actually implies that one should not know too much about the world. That it is actually simplicity that produces purpose.

The famous allegory is of the Genesis story Adam and Eve, where a talking serpent tempts mankind to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Of course, what is implied is that the eating/ participating in true reality, will make you all-knowing, just like God. And so the story goes that mankind, or Adam and Eve, lost their innocence. They were no longer able to live in a paradise where suffering ceases to exist, and the laws of physics don't need to make sense. In other words, if we take Paradise literally, it is a state of bliss we all can appreciate.

Thus, a fantasy world is always a suspension of some kind of outside knowledge. We in the world today may be not super-powerful like a diety who can transcend time. But time gives us our meaning. In microcosm, it is actually the confinement of our consolidated bodies with lots of mass and energy that makes us temporal. However, that acknolwedgement of temporaity is also what gives us our happiness.

What further dimensions are you willing to adopt? Maybe it's time to stay where you are, before you explode like a supernovae.
