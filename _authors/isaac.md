## Aspirations

Isaac is gifted with the love of learning. Throughout his career as a former Art/ Computer Science major, he has non stop sought out the juicy truths of science. He aspires to share these juicy truths of science with the world. Cheers to the wonderful journey of learning. He admires wuthors such as Isaac Asimov. People like him want to spread truth about the world, and create perhaps beautiful stories and art at the same time, to communicate some beauty about this universe. Whether its through art/ science, there is a copnfidence that truth can always be appreciated.

Isaac thinks that lifelong learning is all about changing one's mind based on the evidence. It is this mindset that should characterize the journey of sentient beings. The search for purpose and meaning in one's life is a lifelong journey of learning. Isaac wants to use everything he learns and put it into this website. Isaac believes that almost everyone has a love of the truth. Truth can be beautiful.

Whether it is through the use of language, music, computer science, economics, health science or cosmology he thinks that the ultimate quest to educate the world about its mysteries will never end. As the quote from Carl Sagan's book: “I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls.
The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark
