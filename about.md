title: About
---

I started out with a Bachelor of Arts in English and attained a Masters in Information Technology with a major in Data Analytics.

Througout my 1.7 years experience as an Analyst Data Engineer, I have pieced together my pitch for the kind of value I bring to a company:
I am passionate about new ideas/ ways of working. I am particularly interested in innovative spaces in Penetration Testing and Data Science.

In my day job, I most enjoy utilizing and documenting innovative pieces of code to help my team be more productive.

I also happen to enjoy reading about OffSec topics to further develop my security awareness. I have communicated to stakeholders on
around 20 different metrics for FinCrime, but am looking for more challenges in the innovative space.

I enjoy finding solid and sustainable hygene for adopting a great defensive appetite involving security awareness. I believe that
is a culture and awareness that all teams should have. I aspire to be someone who delivers value in the security space using the latest
techniques and methodologies
