title: Science as a Candle in the Dark

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  I used to have this blog just entitled "data science". My bgackground is data engineering but that was
  not the point. Rather than let the sphere of career political correctness contaminate the message of my blog,
  I do believe that a man's career should outlast him. The key is not to just follow one's passion.
  I believe one should inject passion to truth. In other words, write about science in an educative spirit, but also inject
  some storytelling, intrigue and awe into the pages. \n

  I was enamoured by the way Carl Sagan wrote his books. 
  He was one of the only people who knew how to make science
  inspiring and didn't leave you out as if you were simply a layperson. I wax poetic about science because I don't want to take the dry,
  dreary path that most people speak about science, as if it is this really boring, inapplicable subject done by people with no want
  for practicality, busily trying to be Luddite sophists drooling over the sound of their own thoughts in a private chamber somewhere in a 
  pretentious attic. I cannot capture what it is I do unless it is by the lights of these respectable men, people like Carl Sagan
  and Isaac Asimov. \n
